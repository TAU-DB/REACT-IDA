## The Problem: Modern IDA Recommendations
Modern Interactive Data Analysis (IDA) platforms, such as Kibana,
Splunk, and Tableau, are gradually replacing traditional OLAP/SQL
tools, as they allow for easy-to-use data exploration,
visualization, and mining, even for users lacking SQL and
programming skills. Nevertheless, data analysis is still a difficult
task, especially for non-expert users.
